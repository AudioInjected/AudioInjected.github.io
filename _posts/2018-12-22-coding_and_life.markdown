I keep seeing ads online about programming (targeted advertising...) and how easy it is to learn. just click the ad to find out how.  One thing I learned about programming is that it is not easy, it's difficult. Anything in life worth getting is difficult.  For example, I have been playing guitar for almost 12 years. When I first started to learn guitar it took me a whole week to play an A major chord. One whole week of practicing several hours a day, just to play an A major chord. Just like anyone can learn guitar, anyone can learn programming. Some people learn things faster and get things easier than others. I'm sure there's plenty of people who learned the A major chord in seconds, but that's not the point. You need to put the effort in.
 
There's another aspect of my life that shares similarities with programming, and that's fitness. Back in 2016 I was almost 420 pounds, sick in the hospital because of my Wegners disease. I was also dealing with, and still am dealing with nerve problems from a cyst that I had in my brain. At that moment I decided to focus on my health. I went from almost 420 down to 235 and I'm still working hard to drop body fat. How does this relate to coding? Well, the most important thing I learned when trying to diet and excercise to lose weight is that consistency is king. I don't care who you are, what diet you are following or what workout program you are on. If you are not consistent, you will not see results. You can apply this to coding as well. How are you going to be a good programmer if you don't code or study consistently? You can't program for an hour and then come back a week later expecting things to get easier. If you look at videos online or lecture videos, the programmers there make it look easy, but if that programmer has been programming for 10 plus years and is showing something that they have done thousands of times, of course it looks easy for them. It would be nice if there were shortcuts in life to get to where you want, but then it wouldn't be so special, it wouldn't be worth doing because there's no effort to get there. If there is one thing to take away from this is that you need to remember, embrace, and understand that repitition is the mother of all skill.
