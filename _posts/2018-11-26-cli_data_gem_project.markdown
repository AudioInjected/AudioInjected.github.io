I couldn't think of a clever idea for my data gem project so I decided to try one of the suggestions, which was to make a CLI application that shows you movies opening soon based on the zip code you enter. To be honest, my first thought was "How am I supposed to do this from scratch without tests or a set of instructions?" 

The first thing I did, even before watching the video walkthrough, was to scrape the data that I needed. I figured if I at least had the data everything else would fall in place. I tried to scrape fandango.com but I just couldn't get the data that I wanted and needed. After spending 2 days on it I gave up using fandango. There has to be a reason why I couldn't scrape certain data and I'm still new to web scraping so the best thing to do was try a different web site. I switched to moviefone.com and I was actually able to scrape some data. I immediatelyâ€‹felt better. 

After I scraped some data I watched the video walkthrough and started to work on my project. Not having instructions and tests is daunting, and to be honest, I spent a whole day just setting up the project. I'm new to using "require" and "require_relative" so it took longer than it should have to be set up, but how else do you learn?

After that I was relieved because from that point till the project was complete it was just trial and error. Correcting syntax and parsing the data correctly wasn't easy for me, but it felt good knowing that I knew where I was heading instead of staring at my screen wondering how am I supposed to do this? I couldn't even use "require_relative" to look at my gem file and now I'm actually coding.

I have learned more in the two months I started this bootcamp than I did in the year and a half (or 2, I don't remember) of grad school back when I attended. I was so nervous at first but after watching the video walkthrough (twice) and getting my project set up everything fell into place. After I finished my project I looked at the code and wondered, how did I come up with this? It still feels weird that I wrote that code but I did, and it feels great.
