Before I go into why I used a template, I just want to state that my previous blogs are awful and one of my goals is to become better at writing blogs. 

My cousin is a senior web developer and one of the things he told me was to write all the styling myself in CSS. Avoid Bootstrap at all cost. I searched on Google if it is better for a new developer to build out their portfolio site from scratch or use a template. Here are my reasons why.

### My design skills are weak compared to my other skills

I am weak when it comes to design. I know enough CSS to to do simple things like add margin. The only time I look at CSS is when I'm targeting elements with JavaScript or JQuery. The reason my design skills are weak is because I didn't spend enough time honing those skills (Maybe this is why I love bootstrap so much). I find design difficult. It requires a different way of thinking. I can write the worst algorithm, I'm talking O(n^2) time and space complexity. Code so sloppy that the League of Extraordinary Computer Scientists would track me down and beat me up (They don't exist in this universe so I am safe.... for now). I can push the code and come back another time to write a better algorithm.  I believe you can't do this with design. An app should function well on different devices. I hate when I am writing some style and I finally get something decent, only for the layout to look like I dropped scrabble pieces on the floor when I use the device device toolbar on Chrome to check responsiveness. Design is difficult for me and I will get better at it in the future. I might even take a course or go to school for UX/UI. 

### I wanted my portfolio to look awesome 

I used a template from HTML5Up. They offer free responsive awesome looking templates for you to use. I didn't just use a template and add my projects. I can read the HTML and CSS and I can go into the CSS and change some colors or fonts. For the template I used, I removed a lot of code that I didn't need. Instead of the images that you can put, I embedded YouTube videos of my projects. I can customize the template to how I see fit, although I will say this. I did not change the purple color on my site. It's an awesome shade of purple, like really awesome. [Here's my site](http://rafael-batista.com)
I don't want potential employers to have a difficult time navigating my site. These templates are responsive out the box (I just found out that I need to change the way my Youtube videos are displayed on mobile while checking out the responsiveness on my site). My design skills aren't strong enough for me to be able to make a responsive template like the one I used. It would take me forever to do something like that and I feel that I don't need to build my site from scratch. This leads to my next point.

### I am not a designer

I am not looking for a design position. I know HTML, CSS, Javascript and React so I definitely can work on the front end, but I can not design for the life of me. During my time at Flatiron school I spent many hours learning outside of the course. I learned to write tests using RSpec and Jest. I took a course on data structures and algorithms. I have fun programming and would have a great time writing back end stuff versus using CSS or Bootstrap to design something. If i were offered a front end design position I would respectfully decline (unless they offer to train me). I plan on working on my design skills in the future as they weaker compared to other skills. It may seem negative to point out my weakness but I don't look at it that way. A weakness just means another skill I can develop. It's kind of like a role playing game where you can allocate skill points. My weaknesses are just an opportunity to gain some experience and level up those skills.
