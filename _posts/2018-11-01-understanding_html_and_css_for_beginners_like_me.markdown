What helped me to understand websites is by looking at what makes up a web page into three parts (I am not certain if it is only these three things I am speaking from the prespective of someone new to this.....because I am)

* HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language
* CSS: Cascade Style Sheet

So HTML is basically what makes up a web page in terms of content. The tis xts, links, pictures, all of this is with html. Picture the HTML like a newspaper article, there's pictures and a bunch of texts. Nothing fancy.

CSS is where all the aesthetics come from. All the colors, graphics, the "style" is due to CSS. Imagine taking that newspaper article and turning it into a full color magazine article with cool fonts and colors.

Now the third thing (I didn't mention this earlier) is the functionality of the web site. So you have an awesome website with cool graphics for an online store for example. What about animated images or interactive maps  and scrolling videos. That's what a language like Javascript is for.

So to recap, you make your website with HTML by writing all your tags with texts and links and pictures. You use CSS to make your webiste look awesome and give it style. Then you use a language like Javascript to give your website functionality like clicking on a map and zoom in or a slideshow of different photos.

This is how I distinguish between HTML and CSS. I'm pretty sure I will be able to describe it better once I get more familiar with this.
